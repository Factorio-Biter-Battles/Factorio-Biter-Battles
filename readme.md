## Overview
Biter Battles is an advanced Factorio scenario that transforms the game into a team-based, indirect competitive experience. Two teams, North and South, compete to outlast each other by strategically managing their own defense while simultaneously working to strengthen the enemy's biters.

The premise is unique: biters have discovered that each team is secretly hoarding fish in their rocket silo. Your objective is twofold - defend your silo from increasingly powerful waves of biters, while feeding your opponent's biters with science packs to accelerate their evolution and threat level.

## Key Features
- Team-based indirect PvP gameplay (North vs South)
- Strategic biter feeding mechanics using science packs
- Mirrored map layout for balanced competition
- Landfill-proof horizontal border river separating the teams
- No direct player vs player combat
- West and East areas free of biter nests for factory expansion and outpost building
- North and South directions dedicated to biter territories
- Evolution and threat mechanics tied to feeding and time progression
- Rocket silo defense as the primary objective
- Construction robots restricted to team's own side
- Spy fish mechanics for limited intelligence gathering

For developers or server hosts:
Please refer to our detailed [Installation Guide for Developers](installation-guide.md) for instructions on setting up the scenario.

## How to Play

### Game Mechanics
1. Join either the North or South team
2. Establish and expand your base, with a focus on defending your rocket silo
3. Research technologies and produce science packs
4. Use science packs to feed the enemy team's biters through a special feeding mechanism
5. Higher tier science packs yield stronger mutagenic results in enemy biters
6. Balance resource allocation between defense and offensive feeding strategies
7. The team whose rocket silo survives the longest wins

### Strategies
- Early Game: Focus on establishing basic resource production and defense
- Mid Game: Balance between improving your own technology and feeding enemy biters
- Late Game: Manage advanced resource chains while dealing with increasingly powerful biter attacks

Remember:
- Only feeding enemy biters and time progression increases their power
- There's no major direct PvP combat, so focus on strategy and resource management
- Use spy fish to gather intelligence on the enemy team's progress
- Coordinate with your team for the most effective defense and feeding strategies
