Reduces when biters are slain.\n  *    A high threat value causes bigger attacks. Values of zero or below will cause no attacks.\n  *    Feeding gives permanent "threat-income" (aka passive threat), as well as creating instant threat.\n\n[font=default-large-semibold][color=acid]M a p   N o t e s[/color][/font]\n\n  *    To send [item=space-science-pack] from your inventory, click on the [entity=big-biter] menu and click on the appropriate flask.
