Reduces when biters are slain.\n->  A high threat value causes bigger attacks. Values of zero or below will cause no attacks.\n->  Feeding gives permanent "threat-income" (aka passive threat), as well as creating instant threat.[/font]\n\n----------------------------------\n\n[font=default-large-semibold][color=acid]M a p   N o t e s[/color][/font]\n\n[font=scenario-message-dialog]->  To send science from your inventory, click on the fish menu and click on the appropriate flask. You can also send a fish to spy on the other team.\n->  There is no major direct pvp combat.\n->  The horizontal border river is landfill proof.\n->  Construction robots can not build on the other teams's side.\n->  The Map is mirrored to provide a fair competition.\n->  There are no biter nests in West and East directions, feel free to expand and outpost\n->  There are infinite biter nests in the North and South directions. Proceed with caution[/font]\n\n----------------------------------\n\n[font=default-large-semibold][color=acid]R u l e s    a n d     R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s[/color][/font]\n\n[font=scenario-message-dialog]->  New to the game? We recommend playing single player for at least 50-100 hours, or until you successfully automate blue science, to get more out of your BB experience. \n->  Feel free to [color=pink]spectate[/color] or read one of the [color=pink]pinned guides[/color] on [color=purple]Discord[/color] in the [color=purple]bb-learn[/color] channel.

It's a game, let's all enjoy it! \n->  Here are recommendations specific to game play\n        - Ask before joining an outpost\n        - Ask before removing/changing a big part of the base\n        - Don't spend all your iron on ammo\n        - Avoid red belts, unless you know what you're doing\n        - Don't give bots repair packs, unless you know what you're doing[/font]
