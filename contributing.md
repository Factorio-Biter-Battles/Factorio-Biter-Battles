# Beginner Guide - Contributing to the git repo
Many of the guides in the internet will probably explain it better e.g. https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

## I've set it up before
Run the following to create a new branch and make changes as usual:
- ```git fetch```
- ```git checkout master``` - switch to master
- ```git reset origin/master``` - update your local copy of master to match github
- ```git clean -f```
- ```git branch <new branch>```
- ```git checkout <new branch>```

## I'm setting it up for the first time

### Create a fork
Go to https://github.com/1pulse/factorio_biter_battles, then click fork.

### Clone the repo
- Go to your [Factorio scenarios folder](https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_data_directory) (try %APPDATA%/roaming/factorio/scenarios)
- Run ```git clone <repo>```

repo is the url of your fork which you can get from the green ```Code``` button in github.

>You may want to change the name of the folder that resulted from git clone.
><br>To test changes, create a new game using the scenario whose name matches the folder name generated by the git clone.
><br>View Testing section for more details

### Check your remote settings

Run ``` git remote show origin ``` which would show something like this
<br>This uses SSH version which assumes that you have [ssh keys setup](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
<br>The https urls should still work.

```  
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:1pulse/factorio_biter_battles.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:<your fork>
```

If it's not like the above:

Set the fetch url
```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:1pulse/factorio_biter_battles.git
```
Set the push url
```
git remote set-url origin --push <your repo>
```

---
### Branching
Create a branch: ``` git branch <branch name> ```

Switch to your branch: ```git checkout <branch name> ```

>Branches are a snapshot in time. You can break it as much as you want and can still switch to the original branch which is usually named either ```master``` or ```main```. You can also have multiple branches at the same time.

### Make your changes
Make your changes using your favourite editor
- To see the list of files that you've changed: ```git status```
- To see the changes you've made: ```git diff``` or ```git diff <filename>```

Stage your changes: run ```git add <filename>``` or ```git add . ```(to add all files with unstaged changes)

Commit your changes: run ```git commit -m "your custom commit message"```

### Testing
Open the Scenario locally and test your changes.

Run Factorio and select either:
- Single Player > New game >
  <br> or
- Multiplayer > Host New Game >

Under User Scenario's select ```<my-BB-renamed-folder>```

where ```<my-BB-renamed-folder>``` is the folder name that you changed the cloned version to.

### Submit a pull request
Once you are happy with your changes: run ```git push```
This will send the changes in your local branch to your branch in github.

If you get the error
```
fatal: The current branch <your-branch-name> has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
```

Run the command ```git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name> ```

In your github repository, click ```Compare & pull request```
- base repository: ```1pulse/Factorio-Biter-Battles```
- base: ``master``
- head repository: ```<your-repo-name>```
- compare: ```<your-branch-name>```

Write a small comment about your changes and Click ```Create pull request```
